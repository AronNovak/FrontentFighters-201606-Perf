# JS Profiling

Profiling: general technique to measure memory / CPU / other resource usage.

* Browsers typically have built-in profiler for JavaScript
* As node.js is based on Chrome V8, it has built-in profiler too

Typical result:
* (dynamic) call graph
* function (names), edges, metadata
* profilers might come with neat UI to discover this graph
